# Data Collection Challenge
From Module 11: Data Collection from the Data Analytics Boot Camp by Monash University and EdX.

By implementing skills learnt throughout the module, an attempt at the challenge has been submitted here.

## Contents
- `mars_temp.csv` - output file
- 2 `.ipynb` files

## Explanation
### Part 1: Mars News
Article titles and previews were scraped and added to a dictionary. The dictionary was then stored in a list.

### Part 2: Mars Weather
Data from the table on the website was scraped and added to a list. The list was then turned into a DataFrame and all data types were changed to the appropriate data types. Graphs of the temperature was then made to analyse the temperature data on Mars.

## Credits
